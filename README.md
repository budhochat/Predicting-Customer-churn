# Predicting Customer Churn  

**Description:** Predicting customer churn or the customers who might leave the service is critical for business. In this project, we use the data 
on Telco customer to create a machine learning model to predict if a customer is likely to  churn i.e. leave the service.

Data from:  https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

**Files:** Dataset in the Data folder. <br>  Customer_churn_EDA.ipynb - Exploratory Data analysis and visualization <br> Customer_churn_prediction.ipynb - Data preprocessing, Machine learning Modeling, Analysis and Prediction <br> Machine learning models saved in Models folder <br>


**Modeling**  Performed Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Support Vector Machines, Kernel Support Vector Machines and Gradient boosting (XGBoost). XGBoost performed the best. <br>
